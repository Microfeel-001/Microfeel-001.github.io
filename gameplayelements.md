## Generating dynamic gameplay elements in sandbox video games using multimodal large language models

**Abstract:**

Dynamic content generation is a cornerstone of engaging video game design, offering players tailored and immersive experiences. This paper investigates the transformative potential of advanced artificial intelligence technologies—specifically multimodal Large Language Models, AI Agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation in crafting dynamic, context-sensitive game content. By leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, coupled with the strategic autonomy of AI agents, the proposed framework integrates multimodal inputs such as textual data, visuals, and in-game interactions to generate rich, adaptive gameplay scenarios. The study explores key challenges, including contextual alignment, scalability, and real-time responsiveness, and evaluates methods for optimizing the integration of RAG to enhance narrative depth and player engagement. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between AI-driven content generation techniques and game design, paving the way for innovative methodologies that redefine interactive storytelling and user agency in video games.
