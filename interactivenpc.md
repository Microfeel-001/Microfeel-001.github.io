## AI-Enhanced NPC Interaction: Utilizing AI Agents for Realistic and Adaptive Non-Player Character Behavior

**Abstract:**

 Realistic and adaptive non-player character behavior could enhance the immersive gaming experiences. This paper explores the integration of Large Language Model based AI Agents to enhance NPC interactions with both their environment and other entities, including players and other NPCs. Leveraging the contextual understanding and generative capabilities of LLMs, AI Agents enable NPCs to exhibit contextually appropriate, goal-driven, and dynamically evolving behaviors within the constraints of game design. The framework incorporates multimodal inputs—such as environmental changes, player actions, and NPC state variables—processed through the agent’s decision-making system. Additionally, Retrieval-Augmented Generation modules are utilized to provide long-term memory and access to fixed rulesets, ensuring consistent and informed NPC responses. This study addresses key challenges, including scalability, real-time responsiveness, and narrative coherence, while providing insights into optimizing NPC behavior to improve player engagement. The proposed approach is evaluated across several game scenarios, demonstrating its ability to foster richer, more lifelike interactions that adapt fluidly to the complexities of modern gaming environments.
